modified with new generator: biallass@cern.ch (11/May/2006)
new version of new generator: biallass@cern.ch (28/May/2007)

history: new version of parametrization of energy and angular distribution of cosmic muons,
         now based on new version 6.60 of CORSIKA (2007). Revisited parametrization, now using slightly different polynomials and new coefficients.
new range: 3...3000 GeV, cos(incident angle) = 0.1...1 which means theta=0°...84.26° where z-axis vertical axis  
           Now parametrization obtained from full range, thus no extrapolation to any angles or energies needed any more.
accuracy: now well known, see internal note for details
          7% for range 10...500 GeV, 50% for 3000 GeV and 25% for 3 GeV
documentation: CMS internal note 2007 "Improved Parametrization of the Cosmic Muon Flux for the generator CMSCGEN" by Biallass + Hebbeker


Run in batch mode (and write events):
======================================
set up the environment, compile, run in the directory /GeneratorInterface/CosmicMuonGenerator/
  eval `scramv1 runtime -csh`
  scramv1 b
  cd test
  cmsRun ____.cfg  (possible are CosmicMuonsSurface.cfg or CosmicMuonsUnderground.cfg)


Run in interactive mode (event display, can be disabled in CosmicMuonParameters.h for gain in speed):
=========================================
in order to run in ROOT execute following lines:
  source root4.csh   (or eval `scramv1 runtime -csh`)
  ln -s ../../../GeneratorInterface GeneratorInterface
  root
  .x ---_--   (possible are: cos_sf, cos_ug or geo_el)
  rm GeneratorInterface   (otherwise you will get problems with scramv1)
