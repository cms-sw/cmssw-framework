\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This is the main steering area for FastSimulation. The following configurations can be relevant for the user:

- FamosSequences_cff.py <br>
It includes all the FastSim specific sequences for simulation and reconstruction

- EventContent_cff.py <br>
FastSim specific customizations of the usual event contents are defined here

- HLT_GRun_cff.py <br>
As the corresponding one in HLTrigger/Configuration, but with the FastSim specific HLT menus

- Validation_cff.py and Harvesting_cff.py <br>
FastSim specific sequnces for release validation and harvesting

- RandomServiceInitialization_cff.py <br>
Initialization of random numbers used in FastSim

- Geometries_cff.py <br>
Detector geometries and parameters used in FastSim are listed here;
in particular, Geometries_START_cff.py and Geometries_MC_cff.py customize, respectively, the parameters for the
STARTUP and MC detector conditions

- mixFastSimObjects_cfi.py and mixNoPU_cfi.py <br>
Deal with mixing module

In the /test repository there are several maintained configurations for running FastSim under a few common
general assumptions (although the preferred way of producing FastSim events is through normal cmsDriver commands)
