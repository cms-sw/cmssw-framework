\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

The MuonSimHitProducer package propagates the muon particle through the muon chambers, and generates the same objects as the corresponnding g4SimHit producer, namely:
- A collection of PSimHit with label "MuonCSCHits";
- A collection of PSimHit with label "MuonDTHits";
- A collection of PSimHit with label "MuonRPCHits".

The following material effects can be switched on in the muon chambers:
- dE/dx (default: ON);
- multiple scattering (default: ON);
- bremssstrahlung (not yet fully implemented, default: OFF).

An emulation of the RecHit reconstruction inefficiency due to delta-ray emission is implemented (at the level of SimHit's),
and it is customizable separately in CSC and DT through the parameters simHitCSCIneffParameters and simHitDTIneffParameters
