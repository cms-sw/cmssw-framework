\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This package allows the production of RecHits in the Tracker, starting from the PSimHits created by the intersections of the charged particle trajectories
and the actual sensitive modules of the tracker, the position of which is taken from the tracker reconstruction geometry. 
The RecHit production consists in taking all the PSimHit's generated by the FamosSimHit producer, and applying a smearing to their position,
according to the average resolution functions predicted by the GEANT-based simulation for single muons, for each of the pixel and silicon detector layers. 
RecHit's are also ordered for subsequent use in the default fastsim tracking, in which only hits produced by a given simTrack are fitted, without using a
time demanding full pattern recognition.

The steering of the Tracker RecHit production is configured in SiTrackerGaussianSmearingRecHitConverter_cfi.py
