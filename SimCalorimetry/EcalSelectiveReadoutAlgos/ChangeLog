	* interface/EcalSelectiveReadoutSuppressor.h:
	. implemented recommandation of condition DB experts (from Francesca C. and Vincenzo I.):
	 - types double changed into float.
	 - removed dependency of CondFormats/EcalObjects on FWCore/ParameterSet and moved most
	   of methods of EcalSRSettings format object into EcalSRCondTools class of package
	   SimCalorimetry/EcalSelectiveReadoutProducers
	 - declared DB mapping to BLOB for large std::vector fields of EcalSRSetting
	   (in principle > 12 elements)

	* src/EcalSelectiveReadoutSuppressor.cc:
	. fixed a bug introduced with V02-03-00 (rev 1.35) that was resulting in suppression of every digis
	. restored the cout commented out by previous commit as LogDebug and LogError

2009-10-26  author  <author@pcsaccms02.cern.ch>

	* interface/EcalSelectiveReadoutSuppressor.h, src/EcalSelectiveReadoutSuppressor.cc:
	. SRF of the four inner corner partial SC changed to unknown to SRF of the main RU (the one reading 5 out of the 6 crystals)
	. Configurable default TTF. Now, with ecalDigi.cfi, uses forced low interest as default.
	. Added a mode (trigByPassMode=1), where TTF is recomputed from trigger primitive (TP) compressed Et issue from the TP module.

	* src/EcalSelectiveReadout.cc, src/EcalSelectiveReadout.h:
	. SR flag (low interest, single..) to actions is now fully configurable.
	. Implemented treatement of forced flags according to what is done in the hardware.
