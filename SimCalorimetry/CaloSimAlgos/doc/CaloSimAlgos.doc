\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This package provides a framework for the digitization of all calorimetry
subsystems.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->

The top-level class is the CaloTDigitizer, which exists
to invoke first the CaloHitResponse, then the subdetector-specific ElectronicsSim.

The CaloHitResponse converts the SimHits into an analog signal.
It requires as inputs a CaloSimParameterMap and a CaloVShape.
Each SimHit is simply an energy deposit at a given time.
The CaloHitResponse applies photostatistics, makes
a pulse shape, and sums up the signals from all pulses
in the channel, for all channels.


The CaloSimParameterMap is provides a channel-by-channel
interface for some parameters which the digitization
simulation expects.  These parameters include
* conversion factors to go from
  -energy to average number of photoelectrons
  -photoelectrons to amplified signal amplitude
  -particle energy to simhit energy (sampling fraction)
* tuneable delay
* properties of the data frame, size, bin of maximum

The CaloVShape provides an interface for a pulse shapes.

The CaloVHitCorrection provides a way for users to 
make corrections to the SimHits on an individual basis.
Some examples of applications might be for delays,
attenuation, smearing, etc.
