\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This package provides the producer of simulated Ecal digis for all the crystals
and strips with no kind of selection (e.g. zero suppression, selective readout).
Its output should normally be processed by other producers of zero suppressed / 
selective read digis, which are the ones which should be normally used for event 
reconstruction (excpet for expert studies and validation).
