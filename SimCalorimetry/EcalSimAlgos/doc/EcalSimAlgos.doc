\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This package provides the electronics simulation for the ECAL and preshower
subsystems.

The EcalElectronicsSim takes as input the analog signal it got
from the CaloHitResponse, in units of photoelectrons.
It applies a factor (from the SimParameterMap) to convert the
signal to fC, and passes it to the EcalCoder

The EcalCoder adds a pedestal and noise, each obtained
through a calibration database interface.
