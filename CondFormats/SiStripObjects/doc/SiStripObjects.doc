\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This package provides the classes that define the conditions objects
available via the EventSetup interface, such as the readout cabling
connections (SiStripFedCabling) for the strip tracker.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->

FedChannelConnection A container class which defines a single FED
channel connection, as well as holding information related to the
position of the connected device(s) within the strip tracker control
system. 
NOTA BENE: the FedChannelConnection class is frequently used
as a data type in method argument lists and as a return type, as it is
an easy way to move hardware identifiers/addresses (eg, FEC crate slot
and ring, CCU address and channel, etc...) and connection information
around.

SiStripControlCabling (Will be deprecated soon.)

SiStripFedCabling Defines the readout cabling connections, ie, which
front-end modules (or more precisely, which pairs of APV25 chips) are
connected to which FED channels, as well as providing information on
the position of the connected device(s) within the control system. The
SiStripFedCabling class handles the "fundamental" FedChannelConnection
objects that represent a single FED channel "connection". 
The SiStripFedCabling class represents the "FED" (or "readout") view
of the detector. Alternative views are the "FEC" (equivalent to
"control") and "DET" (equivalent to "geometrical") views, as defined
by classes in CalibFormats/SiStripObjects).

SiStripNoises (Notes to come.)
SiStripPedestals (Notes to come.)
SiStripReadoutCabling (Will be deprecated soon.)

\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->

No plug-in modules.

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->

None.

\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->

FED cabling classes are essentially complete and stable.
Pedestals and noise classes are under developments.
More calibration objects to be defined.
