\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This package provides the SiStripRawToDigiModule and ancillary classes
(SiStripRawToDigi) that read the strip tracker FED raw data buffers
(IORawData/FEDRawData) and convert their payloads into digis
(SiStripDigi and SiStripRawDigi), depending on the FED readout mode
(one of four: zero suppressed, virgin raw, processed raw, scope mode).

The SiStripRawToDigiModule also handles the "Trigger FED" buffer
provided by the DAQ when operating in local DAQ mode (only!). This
buffer is interpreted as a normal FED buffer, but is identified by its
identifier of 1023. The buffer contains information on run number,
event number, etc, as well as commissioning-related parameters (that
are used by the commissioning analysis).

Conversely, the OldSiStripDigiToRawModule and ancillary classes
(OldSiStripDigiToRaw) take digis as input and create FED buffers (all
contained within a FEDRawDataCollection), with the payloads reflecting
one of the four FED readout modes.

Both the RawToDigi and DigiToRaw converters use the readout cabling
map thast defines the connections between the front-end hybrids and
the FEDs (SiStripFedCabling), accessible via the EventSetup interface.

An additional plug-in module is SiStripTrivialDigiSource, which
creates dummy digis (with positions and ADC values according to a
pseudo-random number generator) and attaches them to the Event. This
provides a digi source for the DigiToRaw module and is for testing
only.

SiStripTrivialDigiAnalysis provides a simple analysis of digi
statistics, positions and "landau's", to be used as a debug tool only.
