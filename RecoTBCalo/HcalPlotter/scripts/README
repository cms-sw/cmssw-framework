Instructions for use of CMSSWPlotAll
------------------------------------

===============================================================================
Release: 2.4.0
===============================================================================

P. Dudero (dudero@physics.umn.edu)
K. Klapoetke (klapoetke@physics.umn.edu)

Compatibility: CMSSW_1_4_X

Changes
-------

- New electronics-centric plotting capability; plots can be selected by
  crate/slot/fiber/etc.
- Calibration channels can be plotted by their electronics id's

Setup and Running
-----------------

- Same as in the previous version. Note that the new "reco_setup.rc" has
  an additional "DO_CALIB" variable, so you can control whether calibration
  channels are reconstructed and plottable, or not.

===============================================================================
Release: 2.3.0
===============================================================================

P. Dudero (dudero@physics.umn.edu)

Compatibility: CMSSW_1_3_0

Changes
-------

- New mode "USC" - attempts to reconstruct all available HCAL FED blocks.
- "Mean/RMS" radio button - controls what gets displayed in the Visual
  Selector windows.
- New Pedestal/ADC plots.
- HF ieta=29 is now preferred over HE ieta=29 (which cannot now be plotted)
- Unconnected/unrepresented channels are colored white in the Visual Selector
  windows.
- Compatible with teststand and offline operation (slc3 architecture).

Setup - HCAL teststands
-----

1) Create a work area any old place you like.

> mkdir myPlotAllWorkArea
> cd myPlotAllWorkArea

2) copy the PlotAll scripts into the work area (and README if you want)

> cp $HCALDAQ_SW_LOC/src/$HCAL_CMSSW_RELEASE/src/RecoTBCalo/HcalPlotter/scripts/*.* .
> cp $HCALDAQ_SW_LOC/src/$HCAL_CMSSW_RELEASE/src/RecoTBCalo/HcalPlotter/scripts/README .

3) You're good to go! Proceed to the "Running" instructions below.

-----

Setup - offline (SLC3 architecture - cmsru2, lxslc3, etc.)
-----

1) Create a CMSSW_1_3_0 working area using the "scramv1 project" command:

> scramv1 project CMSSW CMSSW_1_3_0

2) Under this area, check out from CMSSW CVS the following tags:
(assumes you have "cms-cvs-utils" installed):

> cd CMSSW_1_3_0/src
> cmscvsroot CMSSW
> cvs co -r V00-01-01 RecoTBCalo/HcalPlotter
> cvs co -r V00-01-14 RecoTBCalo/HcalTBObjectUnpacker
> scramv1 build

3) Create a work area for yourself and copy the PlotAll scripts to this area.
The instructions under "Running" below assume that this work area is a
subdirectory under CMSSW_1_3_0/src.

> mkdir myPlotAllWorkArea
> cp RecoTBCalo/HcalPlotter/scripts/*.* myPlotAllWorkArea
> cp RecoTBCalo/HcalPlotter/scripts/README myPlotAllWorkArea # this readme

Running
-------

Same as for previous instructions below, with the following additions/changes:

- "cd" to the work area created in the instructions above, and there type the
  "eval" command.
- "reco_setup.rc" file has new mode "USC". All modes are described in the file.

===============================================================================
Release: 2.0.0 beta
===============================================================================

P. Dudero (dudero@physics.umn.edu)

Compatibility: CMSSW_1_1_1

Setup
-----

1) Create a CMSSW_1_1_1 working area using the "scramv1 project" command.
   Examples for previous versions are given below. (At most teststands,
   this will be done by user daqowner.)
2) Under this area, check out from CMSSW CVS the package
   RecoTBCalo/HcalPlotter. No specific tag is needed for the present.
3) Execute

  eval `scramv1 runtime -csh`   [if you run tcsh or csh as shell, as daq does]
  eval `scramv1 runtime -sh`    [if you run bash or zsh as shell]

  in the CMSSW_1_1_1/src directory. This must be done once per login.

4) "cd" to "RecoTBCalo/HcalPlotter" and build this package by executing
   "scramv1 build". 
5) Under the CMSSW_1_1_1/src directory, create an area that will hold the
   CMSSWPlotAll files.
6) Now you can edit the "reco_setup.rc" file to select the appropriate
   map file for the data you are interested in, and to specify a pedestal
   file or gains file if you have one to use. In addition, to use the
   "Process run number" feature, specify a printf-style format string
   that gives the full path to the directory where raw data files will be
   placed. Examples include

   FORMAT="/somedir/someotherdir/HTB_%06d.root"  # full path
   FORMAT="HTB_%06d.root"                        # current working dir
   FORMAT="../siblingdir/HTB_%06d.root"          # relative to the working dir

   (The "%06d" part of the format string indicates where the run number will be
   placed, and that it will have 6 total digits zero-padded on the left. This
   is a common filename format used at Hcal test stands.)

Running
-------

1) Before you do anything, you must go to "CMSSW_1_1_1/src" and run

  eval `scramv1 runtime -csh`   [if you run tcsh or csh as shell, as daq does]
  eval `scramv1 runtime -sh`    [if you run bash or zsh as shell]

  This must be done once per login.

2) To plot:

  root
  root[0] .x PlotAll.C()

  Then, enter a run number and click "Process", or click "Browse..." to browse
  to the file that you want to look at. The tool will automatically spawn a
  reconstruct job and then load the resulting histograms into its internal memory.
  From there you can then make plots from the menu.

  Hint: Try the visual selector!  You can double click on a cell to get a plot
        of the values for that cell.

To Adjust Plotting
------------------

You can easily adjust the range and bins for the various flavors of histograms
by editing the "reco_setup.rc" file.  All the bin counts and ranges
are defined at the bottom of this file.

J. Mans    (jmmans@physics.umn.edu)

Compatibility: CMSSW_0_6_0 --> CMSSW_0_8_1

Setup
-----

1) You will need a working area of CMSSW.  You only need to make a working area
   once.  For example, if your login name was "fred":

 On a MOE machine:

  mkdir /home/daq/fred
  cd /home/daq/fred
  scramv1 project CMSSW CMSSW_0_8_1

 On LXPLUS
  scramv1 project CMSSW CMSSW_0_8_1

2) Next, copy all the files in the CMSSWPlotAll package to a personal working
   area.  This could be CMSSW_0_8_1/src or another directory.

3) Now, you can edit the "reco_setup.rc" file to select the appropriate
   map file for the data you are interested in, and to specify a pedestal
   file or gains file if you have one to use.  You may have to edit 
   runCMSSWReco.sh in certain cases (to change which samples are pulled from 
   the file, etc.)


Running
-------

1) Before you do anything, you must go to "CMSSW_0_8_1/src" and run

  eval `scramv1 runtime -csh`   [if you run tcsh or csh as shell, as daq does]
  eval `scramv1 runtime -sh`    [if you run bash or zsh as shell]

  This must be done once per login.

2) There are different scripts to reconstruct from HCALdaq files or
    from centrally-produced CMSSSW files.

  To reconstruct a file from the HCAL daq:

   ./runCMSSWReco.sh [the file]

  So ./runCMSSWReco.sh /data/spool/HTB_024019.root will produce 
  "HTB_024019-cmsswreco.root" in your local directory.  You should delete these
  processed files when you no longer need them.  (There may be automated 
  cleanup in the future).

  To reconstruct a centrally produced CMSSW file:

   ./runCMSSWRecoGlobal.sh [the file]

  ** NOTE : If the CMSSW file has already been reconstructed, you can skip
  **  right to step (3) and ignore the "runCMSSWRecoGlobal.sh" step. 
  

3) To plot:

  root
  root[0] .x PlotAll.C

  Then, "Load POOL File" on the file you want.  You can then make plots
  from the menu.

  Hint: Try the visual selector!  You can double click on a cell to get a plot
        of the values for that cell.


To Adjust Plotting
------------------

You can easily adjust the range and bins for the various flavors of histograms
by editing the "HistoManager.cc".  All the bin counts and ranges
are defined at the top of this file.


TB06 Specific
-------------

PlotAllBeamCounters will make various plots of TB06 beam counters.  To use, 
click the Plot Beam Counters button, and choose a POOL file which has unpacked 
TB06 beam counter information.  Histo ranges and binning can be adjusted at the 
top of PlotAllBeamCounters.C
