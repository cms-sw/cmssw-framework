Timing service - 20-12-05 jbk

 Initial version.  It prints one record per module and per event that
 indicates how long that step took.  There is no currently no configuration.
 The report is not going out to the logger yet, mainly because of the 
 ugly output format.
 The framework does not give callbacks for start path / end path yet.
 When is does, this thing should sum the times across all modules that
 executed in that path (even if they did not run because they ran in an
 earlier path) and report that time for the path.
 No summaries are being kept now either.  Histograms would be nice
 (per module or across all events).  A big listing of total times spent
 in each module/path would also be nice.
