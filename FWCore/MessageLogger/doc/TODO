<ALL DONE!>
		

Known for Phase 2

statistics destination(s) 

Destination connecting to log4cplus - set up the basics involving
EventFilter package dependency and so forth.

Destination connecting to log4cplus - polish

Information order (is time etc first or last...)

Default behaviour (particularly destination) if none provided.

Deal with case of ofstream failing to construct.

Multiple types in a message ID (note - this requires ErrorLogger work) -
we need first to discuss the meaning of this, both in filtering and in
statistics.

Vet the Guide to Issuing CMS MessageLogger Messages

If no destinations attached, re-enable cerr (may already be done)

Add string name for debug's severity of DEBUG to map (may already be done)

Figure out how CMS wants to specify which directory the log files should go to

other filtering options

context

endl support

multi-statement message building

logger control after configuration - first decide if this is to be done at all

			Recommended options
			-------------------

Way to incorporate Module name


ErrorLogger has a scheme for establishing debug verbosity levels and
discriminating about whether a given message will be rapidly discarded
based on the level assigned. The LogDebug mechanism should be able to 
exploit that scheme.
