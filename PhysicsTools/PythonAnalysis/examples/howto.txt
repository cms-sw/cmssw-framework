# How to use the python examples in CMSSW

# Beginning with CMSSW_1_3_X the following lines aren't needed any more. Instead you do "scramv1 b" after checkout
# You need to include cms helper classes in PYTHONPATH ("cmstools")
bash: export PYTHONPATH=$CMSSW_BASE/src/PhysicsTools/PythonAnalysis/python:$PYTHONPATH
csh: setenv PYTHONPATH $CMSSW_BASE/src/PhysicsTools/PythonAnalysis/python:$PYTHONPATH

#execute examples via
python example.py

# read generatorOutput.root and print the generated event number
python MCTruth.py    # standard ROOT and FWLite
python MCTruth2.py   # with cmstools

# makes some tracker plots
python trackerHits.py
