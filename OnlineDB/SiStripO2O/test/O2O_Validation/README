This folder contains all tools necessary to validate an O2O procedure
for the following conditions: SiStripFEDCabling, Noise, Pedestal.
To do a full validation please run the following script. 

Full validation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
./run_full_valdation.sh  "tag_orcoff" "tag_sqlite" "dbfile"
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If You only want to da a validation of some single Objects You can run the single 
standalone scripts.


FEDCabling validation:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
./fedcabling_validation.sh "sqlite_file.db" runnr "offline_tag"

FEDCabling validation relys on only a sqlite file which has to be present
in the directory You run the script. Apart from that make sure that the following
variables are set correctly: $TNS_ADMIN, $CONFDB, also make sure that the correct 
path to the tnsnames.ora is set and finally open a tunnel to the P5 machine where 
the DB is running!
Time estimation per run: ~2 minutes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Pedestal & Noise Validation:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is c++ and has to be compiled before using. ROOT 5.20/00 is mandatory!
make
./pednoise_validation runnr_1 runnr_2 tag_1 tag_2 > anyoutfile.txt

Pedestal & Noise validation relys on the files created by DQM processes. Both files
of a run containing old and new tags have to be present in the script folder to do 
the validation. Since a validation for 10M strips takes its time, this procedure is 
quite lenghty.
Time estimation per run: ~1 1/2 hours
