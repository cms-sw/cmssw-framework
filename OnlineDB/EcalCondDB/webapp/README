ECAL Conditions Database Web Application

This PHP code allows the user to browse the ECAL conditions database
and make plots.

(Reccommended) Requirements:
PHP 5+
Apache 2+
CMSSW 0_7_0+

Expectations:

1. All PHP source files are in the same directory
2. Apache has rights to write into this directory
3. A CMSSW release was bootstrapped into the above directory, the
package OnlineDB/EcalCondDB was checked out from CVS and built.  This
places the cmsecal_rootplot program in the CMSSW_*/bin/<arch>/
directory.
4. A directory called 'plotcache' exists and apache has rights to write there
