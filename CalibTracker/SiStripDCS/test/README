======================================

To make this updated version of the code work, you need to check out OnlineDB/SiStripConfigDb and add SiStripPsuDetIdMap as a friend class.
Other points to note:

- Currently no working test job for PopCon interface, as PopCon interface needs updating.

- python/test_map_cfg.py can be used to test the PSU-DetID map

- python/test_builder_cfg.py can be used to test the SiStripModuleHV object builder

- Code that goes with the test python files is in plugins.
