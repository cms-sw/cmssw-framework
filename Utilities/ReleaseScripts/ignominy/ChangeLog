	* runignominy: Deleted the core.* at the end.

2005-05-10  Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	scanning.

2005-03-11  Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* ignominy: scan_config sub-routine now caches the searched result
	for faster lookup (this saved nearly 2 hours for ORCA analysis),
	read/write cache sub-routine are added to saved these results in
	file so that top level projects can use those (e.g. results saved in
	COBRA could be used by ORCA/OSCAr and results in ORCA/OSCAR could
	be used by IGUANACMS).
	* scram-path.pl: read the saved searchcache and make it available
	to the current analysis, _ZGV type symbols ignored.

	configuration. This will make the scram-ignominy to be used
	independent of scram.
	* deps2dot: New prune_edges sub-routine added. Now removing the
	shortest paths are much faster.
	* ignominy: Parsing the actual file instead of link. This makes
	ignominy a bit faster as now instead of parsing a shared
	library and all its links, we only parse the actual file.
	* scram-ignominy: Moved the scram dependent part into the
	scram-path.pl script. Now its almost independent of scram.

	exclude-graphs-self and rename-*.conf files, "-d" command-line
	option can now also recognize so, sp and ds values, QuteXMLRPC
	and X11 tools fixed, metrics created per sub-system level, 
	
	* xmerge: Optimized url and rename sub-routines to cache the
	values to be used in future, added new sub-routines keep_nodes,

	* deps2dot: fixed the prune_edges and has_edge function to first
	convert rename the edge before searching which save a lot of time,
	rename_node is now also remembered the rename value for a node which
	also save time for renaming same node many time.

2004-04-01  Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* scram-ignominy: Bug fix in parsing the --group=value command-line

	* scram-ignominy: Disbaled the reading of 
	<project>/Documentation/Ignominy files, so that ignominy can read the
	configuration files exist in IGNOMINY.

2003-03-03  Shahzad Muzaffar  <Shahzad.Muzaffar@cern.ch>

	* mkall: Appended Ig_Infrastructure/IgNominy/src in PATH

2003-03-03  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* mkall: Don't set PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, they wreak havoc with
	current compilers.  Just rely on properly set up environment.

	architecture names.

2003-03-03  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	all output to that file instead of redirecting every command
	separately.  Auto-generate all compiler-specific rules.  Read
	cross-project logs from the projects themselves (as generated by
	these scripts).  Recognise Solaris X11 directories.  Auto-generate
	SCRAM/CMS default rules.

	* mkdeps: Use simplified configuration file names.

	* path.conf: New file that replaces both path-linux.conf and
	path-sunos.conf.  All platform-dependent stuff is now automatically
	produced by mkconfs.  Remove old crud.

	implicitly found libraries.

2001-09-25  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* path-linux.conf, path-sunos.conf: Updates.  Copy common bits
	from other SCRAM-based projects.  Ignore Motif (unsatisfied +
	dummies from IgG4XDummies) externals until we can get rid of the
	unnecessary references.  Make sure F77 symbols are homed in the
	right packages.  Update compiler search paths.  Remove unnecessary
	matches (now from mkconfs).

	* group-purpose.conf: Recognise more packages.

	* ignominy
	(find_packages): Make sure it is at least a directory.
	(scan_incdata_file): Be more conservative with include files that
	do not have a leading path component: do not look them up in all
	known filenames, only in data we know to be specifically for the
	package.

	* mkconfs: Pick binary name if it was given.  Be better with
	architecture names.

	* path-linux.conf, path-sunos.conf: Recognise classlib and SoQt
	libraries.  Ignore spurious dependency from system libraries to
	CERNLIB.

2001-08-02  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* ignominy: Allow more things about packages to be specified via
	the project configuration file.  Allow backslash to continue lines
	in the config file.
	(scan_config): Pass the resolved file to the action.
	(find_packages): Find nested packages first so that the action
	will know if it is a leaf or not.
	(scan_depdata_file): Scan configurations always with fully
	resolved file paths.
	(scan_depdata_directory): Allow project to define where to look
	for the dependency data for this package.
	(scan_locate_file): Removed, and replaced by...
	(scan_locate_files): ...this.  Locate all files at once.
	(scan_incdata_file): Use quote escapes in regexps instead of
	copied variables.  Adapt to `scan_config' changes.
	(scan_incdata_directory): Scan fortran too.
	(scan_binary_file): Allow binaries to be rejected.  Automatically
	scan all dynamic dependencies too.
	(convert_binary_symbol_definition): Stop on preferred symbol.
	(convert_binary_origin, convert_binary_dynamic_deps): Adapt to
	`scan_config' changes.
	(generate_output): Drop binaries from ignored packages.
	(arch): Adapt to SCRAM changes.
	(main): Allow `.' in source root specification; make it an empty
	directory component to avoid `/./' sequences.

	* path-linux.conf, path-sunos.conf: Move project-specific config
	here now that ignominy supports and requires it.  Remove stuff now
	discovered by enquiring scram, BuildFiles or automatically deduced
	by ignominy from shared library dependencies.  Look in more places
	for generated files.  Search files in more system places now that
	SCRAM has dropped most system headers from dependency data.

	* ps2map: Allow options to be given.  Handle frame targets.

	* xmerge: Split wide tables into several narrower ones.

	* group-domain.conf, group-origin.conf, group-purpose.conf,
	url.conf: Handle some more packages.

	* mkall: Make easier to run, especially for several versions.
	Factor out common stuff from all the other scripts.

	* mkconfs: New, generate configuration from scram.  Moved and
	redone from the code in mkdeps.

	* mklogicalmap: New, for future.

	* mkdeps: Move configuration query to `mkconfs'.  Use set up from
	`mkall'.  Ensure ability to run from outside distribution.

	* mkdirindex: Use set up from `mkall'.  Use frames.  Be more
	adaptive to project settings.  Produce a table legend.  Compress
	the log file and the diagrams.

	* mkgraphs: Use set up from `mkall'.  Make scripts scanning
	package locations more robust.  Fold titles on several lines.

	* mkgifs, mkmetrics, mkxdeps: Use set up from `mkall'.

2001-04-11  Lassi A. Tuura  <lat@iki.fi>

	* ignominy (generate_config): Match generated headers too.
	(generate_output): Skip empty dependencies only for '(UNKNOWN)',
	otherwise the packages will not be seen in the graphing results.
	(main): Accept more than one configuration file.  Set generated
	headers root location.

	* mkdeps: Query SCRAM for external tools and locations for a path
	configuration.  Use the generated configuration and the standard
	one in the analysis.  Be more specific in the warnings grep.

	* mkgraphs: Ignore more IGUANA stuff from imports and external
	dependencies.  Ignore more packages for package-level
	dependencies.  Make sure we match the package name only.  Exclude
	compiler features from package-level dependencies.

	* group-domain.conf, group-origin.conf, group-purpose.conf: Use
	the new SCRAM generated tool domains.  Match more IGUANA top-level
	directories and packages.  Add a new category for framework
	packages.

	* path-linux.conf, path-sunos.conf: Remove externals we now get
	from querying SCRAM.  Recognise `Iguana' as a package and `iguana'
	as its product.  Move to new compilers.  Ignore hacks working
	around missing symbols in TGS OpenInventor.  Ignore symbols for
	plug-in registration.  Search for generated headers; make sure
	other include search always uses a full path so that the search
	succeeds.  Avoid spaces in release matches.  Put X11 and OpenGL in
	`System' scope as that's what we get from the SCRAM query.

	* rename-origin.conf: OpenGL is now in System.

	* url.conf: Fix top-level hyperlinks.
