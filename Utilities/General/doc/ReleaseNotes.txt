	* Added the MapVector class, taken from the original by Jim
	Kowalkowski as used at CDF for many years. I had to make minor
	updates in the class, because CMS is using a newer compiler than
	does CDF. The changes were primarily addition of the keyword
	'typename' where KCC did not require, but recent GCC versions do
	require, its use. I also modified the tests, removing use of the
	ZOOM timer classes. I have not yet made sure the tests are
	comprehensive, nor have I modified them to use CPP_UNIT
