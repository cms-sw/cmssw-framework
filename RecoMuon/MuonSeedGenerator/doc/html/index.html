ancientMuonSeed: currently the default, which uses the same algorithms
originally used in ORCA.  The basic code structure is as follows:

MuonSeedGenerator:
First, looks for "patterns", vectors or RecHits consistent with
a muon.  Then each pattern is turned into a seed by giving
it a Trajectory, an energy and direction with errors.


MuonOrcaPatternRecognition
Looks for patterns by starting from the segments on
outer layers, and trying to add segments from inner layers.

MuonSeedFinder
Turns patterns into seeds.  Essentially hands the work
to MuonDTSeedFromRecHits, MuonOverlapSeedFromRecHits,
or MuonCSCSeedFromRecHits.

MuonCSCSeedFromRecHits
Gets the pT measurement from the phi difference
between the two innermost segments,
using the MuonSeedPtExtractor.  Chooses one of the
segments to use as direction, and overwrites the 
theta direction of the seed with a line to the
origin.

MuonDTSeedFromRecHits
The direction of single segments gives pretty
good pT estimates, too, so we use a weighted
pT of single segments and segment pairs for the pT.

MuonOverlapSeedFromRecHits
These don't work as well as they should at the moment.
In fact, we're seeing ghosts that consist of a good
muon from a DT/DT seed or a CSC/CSC seed, and a bad
DT/CSC seed.
