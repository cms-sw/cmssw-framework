\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This package provides a module for the HLT to construct Muons from tracker Tracks and L2Muons.

<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->

- L3MuonProducer : Creates the L3MuonProducer framework module
that associates L2Muons with Tracker Tracks and performs a
global refit of all hits.  L3MuonProducer has two member classes
which must be configured in the module's configuration file.  The first,
GlobalMuonTrajectoryBuilder, is the algorithm class which constructs the
global muon trajectory.  The second, MuonTrackLoader, converts the
product of GlobalMuonTrajectoryBuilder into persistant objects and loads
them into the Event.

\htmlinclude L3Muons.cfi

<b>Inputs</b>:
- MuonCollectionLabel : the TrackCollection of L2Muons

<b>Products</b>: 
- reco::Muon Collection: label L3Muons 
- reco::Track Collection: label L3Muons 
- reco::Track Collection: label L3Muons:L2Seeded -- These are the
tracker tracks which are regionally reconstructed from seeds inspired by
L2Muons.

Note: For the HLT, the tracker tracks are regionally reconstructed based on the L2Muons.  Thus the TrackerSeedGenerator parameters must be configured.
