\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This package is designed to reconstruct trajectories of muons from outside of the CMS detector, i.e. cosmic and beam-halo muons.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->

- CosmicMuonSmoother: class to refit cosmic and beam-halo muon trajectories
- CosmicMuonTrajectoryBuilder: concrete class to build muon trajectories starting with TrajectorySeeds
- CosmicMuonUtilities: utility class containing common output and fit tools
- GlobalCosmicMuonTrajectoryBuilder: concrete class to build global cosmic muon trajectories containing information from both muon and tracker systems, starting from standalone cosmic muons

\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->

- CosmicMuonProducer: steering class to build and clean muon trajectories, store muon reco::TrackCollection into event

The default configuration file is 
<pre>
\htmlinclude cosmicMuons.cfi
</pre>

\b Inputs: TrajectorySeedCollection with label CosmicMuonSeed

\b Products: reco::TrackCollection with label cosmicMuons

- GlobalCosmicMuonProducer: steering class to build and clean global cosmic muon trajectories, and store muon reco::Track and reco::Muon collection into event

The default configuration file is
<pre>
\htmlinclude globalCosmicMuons.cfi
</pre>

\b Inputs: Two reco::TrackCollections with label cosmicMuons and cosmictrackfinder

\b Products: reco::MuonCollection and reco::TrackCollection with label globalCosmicMuons

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->
- \b SegmentsToTracks.cfg :
to build muon seeds and trajectories after muon local reconstruction

- \b globalCosmicTracks.cfg :
to build global cosmic muon trajectories after standalone cosmic muon reconstruction

- \b validate.cfg :
to validate the package by ploting the resolution and distribution of transverse momentum as well as some other parameters

\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->

The package is stable.

Basic algorithm and structure are in good shape, good efficiency and accuracy have been achieved. Optimization is (always) under-going.
