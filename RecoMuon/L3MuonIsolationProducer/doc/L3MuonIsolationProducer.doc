\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->
Package provides L3MuonIsolationProducer and analyzer (in /test) code.
To be used in HLT for track-based isolation of L3 muons.



\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->
None.

\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->

- L3MuonIsolationProducer
Provide track-based isolation information for L3 muons.
Uses TrackExtractor.
Input: reco::TrackCollection of muons and reco::TrackCollection of "other" tracks (Ctf or PXLS).
Output: 
  -# IsoDepositMap [typedef ValueMap<IsoDeposit>] (optional) with track pt's
  -# edm::ValueMap<bool>  [typedef ValueMap<bool> ] : "is isolated" flags associated to the input muons 
  .
Thresholds for these flags are set in the cff/i via 
  -# "SimpleCuts" Cuts : diff sumEtMin, coneSize for a given muon_eta range
  -# NominalEfficiencyConfigurator: based on effs derived from a nominal signal sample (read from a LUT
previously written out by the L3MuonIsolationAnalyzer).
Up-to date configuration is located in HLTrigger/Muon.

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->
- L3MuonIsolationAnalyzer
Makes muon isolation-related plots based on the output from L3MuonIsolationProducer:
sumPt, eff vs. pt, coneSize.


\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->
Nominal efficiency configuration will migrate to using dBase when available.
