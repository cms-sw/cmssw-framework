This package, SiStripMonitorHardware, is used to online monitor the metadata from the FEDs. <br />
Many of the detected errors are making one each other. For example if a channel is out-of-synch
it will most probablyb also show an APV address error. This code takes care of reporting only the most significant
error.<br />
The code can run without any connection to the database, but it is really meant to work with some\connection to the database:
either online or offline. If you run without the database informatio on the conection, you will be warned every time
a channel is disabled, provided that the front-end unit hosting the channel is enabled. Running with the database avoids this problem.
