extractErrors.C 
----------------- 

Script to look inside the DQM file and print a list of bad APV/channel
numbers due to different FED channel error types (APVAddressError,
APVError, Out-of-sync, Unlocked), and FE numbers of FEs with
errors. It also gives the percentage of events for which each channel
is in the given error.  CHANNEL/FE ARE REPORTED IN INTERNAL NUMBERING
SCHEME (0-95/0-7, FE #0 is channel 0-11).


To compile :

g++ -g -m32 -Wall -ansi -I $ROOTSYS/include -o extractErrors \
extractErrors.C -L $ROOTSYS/lib `root-config --glibs`

and to execute:
./extractErrors <file> <run number>


It is currently made for the online DQM file, where the FED errors  
can be found in the following directory:
DQMData/Run XXXXXX/SiStrip/Run summary/ReadoutView/
but this can easily be changed to anything in the script if needed.

It outputs a file FEDChannelErrors_runXXXXXX.txt
