An explanation of what the various monitorables mean.

errorType - a number (25-38) indicating the type of error recorded.
	25 indicates an invalid ROC of 25
	26 indicates a gap word
	27 indicates a dummy word
	28 indicates a FIFO full error
	29 indicates a timeout error
	30 indicates a TBM error trailer
	31 indicates an event number error (TBM and FED event number mismatch)
	32 indicates an incorrectly formatted Slink Header
	33 indicates an incorrectly formatted Slink Trailer
	34 indicates the event size encoded in the Slink Trailer is different than the size found at raw to digi conversion
	35 indicates an invalid FED channel number
	36 indicates an invalid ROC value
	37 indicates an invalid dcol or pixel value
	38 indicates the pixels on a ROC weren't read out from lowest to highest row and dcol value

NErrors - the total number of errors recorded.

fullType - the FIFO type that was recorded as being full for an errorType 28.  A value of 1-5 indicates FIFO 1 is full (where the value 1-5 is the channel of FIFO 1 that is full).  A value of 6 signifies FIFO 2 full.  A value of 7 signifies a nearly full trigger FIFO.

chanNmbr - is the number of the FED channel that timed out for an errorType 29.

TBMMessage - is the message contained in the data bits of the TBM trailer for an errorType 30.  The following are possible values for TBMMessage:
	0 = stack full
	1 = Pre-cal issued
	2 = clear trigger counter
	3 = sync trigger
	4 = sync trigger error
	5 = reset ROC
	6 = reset TBM
	7 = no token bit pass

TBMType - the state machine message encoded in a TBM trailer for errorType 30.
	0 = no message
	1 = overflow (more than 196 pixels/ROC)
	2 = FSM error
	3 = invalid number of ROCs
	4 = multiple messages

EvtNbr - the event number recorded in the TBM for errorType 31.

evtSize - the size of an event recorded in Slink trailer for errorType 34.

linkId - the invalid FED channel number recorded for errorType 35.

ROCId - the invalid ROC number for errorType 36.

Type36Hitmap - a hitmap that shows the invalid ROC number matched to channel number for errorType 36 in which the detId isn't known.

DCOLId - the invalid dcol value recorded for an errorType 37.

PXId - the invalid pixel value recorded for an errorType 37.

ROCNmbr - the number of the ROC that is read out of order for errorType 38.
