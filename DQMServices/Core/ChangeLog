  * interface/DQMStore.h: Added DQMArchiver as friend class, so that 
  StorageManager Proxy Server doesn't have to create unnecesary 
  dependencies to DQMHttpSource.

	* bin/DumpFile.cpp (hexlify): Finally fix this function to avoid
	sign extension problems in going from signed char to unsigned int
	using a direct cast.

2010-11-12  Marco Rovere  <marco.rovere@cern.ch>

	* src/DQMStore.cc (getMatchingContents): Added the possibility to
	filter MEs based on different flavors of re. The default, for
	backward compatibility, is still based on Wildcards syntax.
