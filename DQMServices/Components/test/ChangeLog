	notification email the username of the user that physically run
	the tests.

	* whiteRabbit.py (send_mail): Added new global function to send
	output email with the results of the tests sent as attachement and
	not embedded into the main mail body. This has the great advantage
	that the attachement can be safely downloaded from any email
	client, included standard gmail web access. The attachement is not
	compressed, but could be in case space becomes an issue.

	* driver14a.sh, driver14b.sh, driver14c.sh: First implementation
	of igprof-test on real pp data. All monitoring is done
	(performance and memory) and three separate sqlite3 files are
	produces for both RECO,DQM and HARVESTING.

2011-01-27  Marco Rovere  <marco.rovere@cern.ch>

	* runtests.sh: Added back all tests. HEAD version is for internal
	usage only.

	small set of tests, namely 1,2,11,12.

	* driver3a.sh, driver3b.sh, driver9a.sh, driver9b.sh,
	driver11b.sh: Change location of checkMem.py script. For the
	moment it is located in my public area. 

	* whiteRabbit.py (notifyMe): Added Suchandra in the list of email
	addresses to which results of the tests are sent.

	* driver1b.sh, driver2b.sh, driver3b.sh, driver4b.sh, driver8b.sh,
	driver9b.sh: Modified the output name of the ROOT file, including
	test and/or step number directly into the filename, before .root
	extension, so that Root becomes smart enough to recognize the
	files.

2011-01-14  Marco Rovere  <marco.rovere@cern.ch>

	* driver3b.sh: Temporary removed all tests related to validation
	sequences, since they are currently broken for this particular
	test. Only RAW2DIGI,RECO,DQM is active and monitored for memory
	usage, both for step2 and harvesting.
