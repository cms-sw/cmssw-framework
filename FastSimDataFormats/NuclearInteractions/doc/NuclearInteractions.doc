\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

Definition of a few DataFormates needed for the specific treatment of the Nuclear Interactions and their secondary vertices in Fast Simulation. <br>
Used by FastSimulation/MaterialEffects.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->

- FSimDisplacedVertex <br>
- FSimDisplacedVertexFwd <br>
This data format is designed to combine the informations from FSimVertex and its FSimVertexType. It is not part of general FastSimulation sequence and useful for  private productions and analyses.

- FSimVertexType <br>
- FSimVertexTypeFwd <br>
It holds the information about the nature of a SimVertex within the Famos or Generation sequences.

- NUEvent <br>
It defines the whole set of simulated tracks exiting from a Nuclear Interaction in the Fast Simulation.
