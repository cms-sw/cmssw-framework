\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This is the electronics simulation for the endcap muon cathode strip chambers.
The outputs are three sets of digis: strips (for phi measurements), wires (for eta
measurements), and comparators (for strip triggers).

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->


\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->

- CSCDigiProducer
- CSCDigiDump
  Provides an ASCII dump of the digis

- CSCNeutronWriter
  Writes a ROOT file of hits from long-lived particles.  See the SimMuon/Neutron documentation.

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->

There is a test to see if the correlated noisifier
returns the input correlation matrix.

\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->
Unknown
