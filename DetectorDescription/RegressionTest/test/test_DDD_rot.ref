Hep3Vector was (1,1,1) and the rotation was 20*deg around that axis.
phiX=0.222914 or in degrees = 12.7721
thetaX=1.7491 or in degrees = 100.216
phiY=1.75353 or in degrees = 100.47
thetaY=1.35147 or in degrees = 77.4338
phiZ=-0.683945 or in degrees = -39.1872
thetaZ=0.284525 or in degrees = 16.3021
some factor/equations...
 sin(thetaX()) * cos(phiX()) = 0.959795
