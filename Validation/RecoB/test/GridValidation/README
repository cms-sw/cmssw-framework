HOW TO RUN VALIDATION ON THE GRID
--------------------------------

Idea is:
	1 - run the first step (only histograms which accumulate event by event) on the grid, preparing .root files in output - using crab
	2 - take the root files locally
	3 - run harvesting on them (with a local job)

1 - for this you need
	- crab: use the crab.cfg in this directory, jut by changing the "datasetpath=" line to the dataset you want to validate
	- all the rest should be as fast as crab -create -submit and waiting for jobs to be Done
	- take locally the MEtoEDMConverter_*.root files with crab -getoutput

2 - put all these files in validation_Harvest.py and cmsRun it. It will produce a POG_V??????_CMSSW_?_?_??.root which contains all the histograms, including efficiencies etc
