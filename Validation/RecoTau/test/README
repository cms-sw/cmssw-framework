The validation TauTagVal.cfg file was created to run on a Tau sample. It 
is recommended to use it on a pure diTau sample or a Z->TauTau sample. As 
it is, it will produce a root file called "tautag_IsoEfValid.root" that 
stores histograms in different folders. The naming of the folder and what they 
contain is the following:

- DQMData/TausAtGenLevel_ConeIsolationForValidation
    Contains histograms of the Taus at Generator Level and histograms of 
    the Tau Jets at Generator level. Tau Jets, are the decay products of
    the orginal Taus minus the momentum of the Neutrino_Tau. They are 
    required to be in a visible part of the detector (|eta| < 2.5 and
    Pt > 5.0 GeV

- DQMData/ReconstructedJet_ConeIsolationForValidation
    Contains histograms of the reconstructed Jets that are matched to a
    generator level jet for a deltaR < 0.15


- DQMData/ReconstructedJetWithLeadingTrack_ConeIsolationForValidation
    Contains histograms of the reconstructed jets with a leading track
    with more than 6 GeV and within a matching cone of 0.1 around the jet
    momentum

- DQMData/TauTaggedJets_ConeIsolationForValidation 
    Contains histograms of the reconstructed jets with a leading track
    that are tagged with the following description:
    Signal cone = 0.07
    Isolation cone = 0.45
    # of tracks in Isolation Ring = 0
    Minimum Pt of tracks = 1.0 GeV

- DQMData/LeadingTrackPtAndDeltaRStudies_ConeIsolationForValidation
   This contains histograms of the behaviour of different leading track
   Pts and the DeltaR of the Leading Track with respect to the direction
   direction of the Jet Momentum. (leading track searching for 1.0 GeV
   minimum Pt and 0.15 matching cone)
    
- DQMData/TaggingStudies_ConeIsolationForValidation
   Contains studdies on the behaviour of the efficiency changing:
    - Isolation Cone Size (0.2, 0.25, .., 0.45)
    - Signal Cone Size (0.07, 0.08,..,0.12)
    - Leading Track Pt (2, 3, .. , 7 GeV)
    - Matching Cone Size (0.07, 0.08,..,0.12)

Some plots can be produced by typing in root the following command:
".x tauTag_IsoEffValid.C"

The values of the isolation parameters can be modified in the config file 
they are passed to the analyzer through it.
