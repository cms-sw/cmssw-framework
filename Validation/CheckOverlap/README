This package provides a SimWatcher which invokes the overlap checking tool 
of GEANT4. It works on the basis of two untracked parameters: "NodeName"
which tells the name of the physical volume at the node from where 
downward the scan of overlap to be performed (if none specified, it starts 
from the top of the tree - WorldVolume) and "Resolution" which is the 
number of points on the surface used in the search for overlaps. 

An example of using this is provided in test/data/run.cfg

The essential addition is
   replace g4SimHits.Watchers = {
             {          string type       = "CheckOverlap"
              untracked string NodeName   = "HCal"
              untracked int32  Resolution = 1000
             } }
