There are 2 sorts of histograms created:

1)Validation test:
-----------------
The validation test verifies the technical behaviour of the mixing, i.e. that 
bunchcrossings are correctly filled by the 
MM, and that values like the vertex pointers and ToF etc are 
correctly shifted. For that it executes the MM for each bunchcrossing, 
restricting the bunchrange to this crossing only, and adding exactly 1 event as a pileup, 
which is the same as the signal event.
   Rereading the output of the MM with TestSuite, it produces a root-file 
containing histograms.


2) Global Tests
------------

These histograms look at the statistical behaviour. Histograms include
NrPileupEvts, NrVertices, NrTracks,  TrackPartId, CaloEnergyEB, CaloEnergyEE



 The histograms are examined automaticalle by executing DoCompare, which
compares with reference histos.To execute the testsuite:

In the test-directory, type

- 'chmod +x testsuite.csh'  to make the shell script executable

-  ovalv1 p testsuite.csh
