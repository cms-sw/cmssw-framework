<h2>Compile and Run</h2>

<p>

<p>Checkout
<pre>
  scramv1 project CMSSW CMSSW_2_1_10
  cd CMSSW_2_1_10/src 
  eval `scramv1 runtime -csh` 
  cvs co RecoJets/JetAnalyzers
</pre>

<p>Compile
<pre>
  scramv1 b 
</pre>

<p>Run
<pre>
  cmsRun RecoJets/JetAnalyzers/test/cruzet4.py
</pre>

<p>You will get a bunch of errors about missing files... but eventually you should get 
printout which looks like:

<pre>
  Begin processing the 108006th record. Run 57381, Event 63185, LumiSection 4 at 14-Sep-2008 14:12:04 CDT
  >>> processing event # run: 57381 event: 63185 time 5235845788462952912
  Begin processing the 108007th record. Run 57381, Event 63186, LumiSection 4 at 14-Sep-2008 14:12:04 CDT
  >>> processing event # run: 57381 event: 63186 time 5235845788462948185
  Begin processing the 108008th record. Run 57381, Event 63187, LumiSection 4 at 14-Sep-2008 14:12:04 CDT
  >>> processing event # run: 57381 event: 63187 time 5235845792757001089
  Begin processing the 108009th record. Run 57381, Event 63188, LumiSection 4 at 14-Sep-2008 14:12:04 CDT
</pre>

<p>You can stop the event processing by hitting <tt>Ctrl-c</tt>. The job should end and the output
files should be written.

<h2>Event Analysis</h2>
<p>The example will run over the cruzet4 reconstructed files
and write out histograms to the file <tt>myhisto.root</tt>. 

<p>The code to analize events is located in:
<pre>
  RecoJets/JetAnalyzers/src/myJetAna.cc
  RecoJets/JetAnalyzers/interface/myJetAna.h
</pre>

<hr>
<h2>Event Filter</h2>

The events passing the filter will be written to the file 
<tt>FilteredEvents.root</tt>.

<p>The code to filter events is located in:
<pre>
  RecoJets/JetAnalyzers/src/myFilter.cc
  RecoJets/JetAnalyzers/interface/myFilter.h
</pre>

<p>The filter loops over the jets and selects events passing a minimum
jet pt requirement or events with jets that have some EM energy:
<pre>
  for ( CaloJetCollection::const_iterator ijet=jets->begin(); ijet!=jets->end(); ijet++) {
    if (ijet->pt() > 100.)                filter_Pt  = true;
    if (ijet->emEnergyFraction() > 0.05)  filter_EMF = true;
  }
</pre>



<hr>
<h2>Scanning Events</h2>

<p>To view events you can use fireworks/cmsShow. This is a standalone
event display which works reasonably well.
<pre>
  wget http://cern.ch/cms-sdt/fireworks/cmsShow21.tar.gz
  tar xzf cmsShow21.tar.gz
  cmsShow FilteredEvents.root
</pre>

<p>If this does not work, refer to the instructions which can be found at:
