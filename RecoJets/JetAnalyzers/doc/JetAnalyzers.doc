\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This package contains jet analysis examples.  Some of them are simple
examples of accessing jets and making just a few plots, that are part
of the CMSSW workbook and should work with every release.  Others are more
complicated user contributed code that does a complete jet analysis and
may only work with a few releases.
