	* instead of requiring (allowing) for an explicit string parameter
	'label', use the label of the es module itself for both
	JetCorrectionService and JetCorrectionServiceChain

	* adjust JetCorrectionProducer to interface change in
	JetMETCorrections/Objects:
	JetCorrector::correction(jet,event,setup) has become
	JetCorrector::correction(jet,jetRef,event,setup)
	* define new L1FastjetCorrectionService and L6SLBCorrectionService
	in plugins/SealModule.cc
	* define new GenJetCorrectionProducer in
	plugins/SealModule.cc. This is useful to cross-check corrections
	which are derived by studying the difference between two different
	GenJet definitions, e.g. one clustered with and one without
	neutrinos
