	* change JetCorrector::correction(jet,evt,setup) interface to also
	contain an edm::RefToBase<reco::Jet> fJetRef.
	* this is useful because extra information about a given jet in
	the event is typically keyed by such a reference
	* note that the reference is always w.r.t. the original
	uncorrected jet, not the jet from the last correction level (as
	the information would have been lost by creating a new jet object)
	* this should not impact any existing correctors, as non was
	implementing this particular interface so far
	* the motivation is the introduction of the new L6SLBCorrector in
	JetMETCorrections/Algorithms, which corrects for leptonic decays
	within a jet and therefore needs to access tagging information for
	each jet in order to determine if a reconstructed muon could be
	matched and if yes, to get to it kinematics
