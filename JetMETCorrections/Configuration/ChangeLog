	* slim down python/JetCorrectionServices_cff.py and
	python/JetCorrectionProducers_cff.py to only define correction
	services and producers for AntiKt R=0.5 CaloJets and PFJets.
	* add python/JetCorrectionServicesAllAlgos_cff.py and
	python/JetCorrectionProducersAllAlgos_cff.py to still cover the
	rest.
	* add test/run_ak5L2L3_cfg.py and test/run_kt4L2L3_cfg.py
	configuration examples, which produce jet pt histograms for
	uncorrected / corrected CaloJets / PFJets. The kt4 example
	demonstrates how the services and producers to correct any
	algorithm can be constructed (cloned) from the existing versions
	for AntiKt R=0.5.

	* add new files to define commonly used jet correction services
	and producers. New mechanism based on JetCorrectionEra_cff.py
	allows for these files (JetCorrectionServices_cff.py and
	JetCorrectionProducers_cff.py) to remain valid when new correction
	parameters become available.
	* Some files in python/ are obsolete or need updating (JPT!?), to
	be followed up soon!
