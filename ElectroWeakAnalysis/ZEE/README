NOTES AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE CODE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


This code creates Wenu or Zee candidates from some configurable trigger stream
and applies some selections. It contains the following files:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
source and header files:
------------------------
WenuCandidateFilter.cc
ZeeCandidateFilter.cc
WenuPlots.h and WenuPlots.cc
ZeePlots.h  and ZeePlots.cc

cfg files:
----------
pat_WenuPlots.py  aod_WenuPlots.py
pat_ZeePlots.py   aod_ZeePlots.py 

macros:
-------
PlotCombiner.cc
inputFiles

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For  details  with  respect  to the  definitions  of  candidates   check   the 
implementation notes in all source files.

There are 2 ways to run this code: either running the whole PAT sequence
(recommended) or bypassing pat and run with whatever exists precalculated
in the AOD collections.

Run the code without running the PAT sequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Quick instruction: cmsRun aod_WenuPlots.py or cmsRun aod_ZeePlots.py


An interface that is provided aod2patFilter.cc creates pat::ElectronCollection 
and pat::METCollection from AOD. This uses the default pat constructors. 
Isolations are added manually to the the PAT objects in the following way:
    myElectron.setTrackIso(elec->dr03TkSumPt());
    myElectron.setECalIso(elec->dr04EcalRecHitSumEt());
    myElectron.setHCalIso(elec->dr04HcalTowerSumEt());
Please edit this part accordingly, if you prefere different isolation 
definitions. No facility to calculate your own isolations is provided. If you
want to do so you have to run the PAT sequence yourself. (see next session)


Running the whole PAT sequence yourself
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Quick instruction: cmsRun pat_WenuPlots.py  or cmsRun pat_ZeePlots.py


The software has been tested and run successfully with the following tags:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Test Release based on: CMSSW_3_1_2
--- Tag ---    -------- Package --------
V01-08-08      CondFormats/JetMETObjects
V05-06-05      DataFormats/PatCandidates
V01-08-04-01   JetMETCorrections/Algorithms
V01-08-21      JetMETCorrections/Configuration
V02-09-05      JetMETCorrections/Modules
V07-08-22-01   PhysicsTools/PatAlgos
V03-07-06      PhysicsTools/PatUtils
V04-02-02      PhysicsTools/PFCandProducer
V02-10-01      RecoJets/JetAlgorithms
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

However,  it  can be run just with  CMSSW_3_1_2 without  any further  tags and
should produce the same results.

    (the following hold for both Wenu and Zee plots)
    In the cfg file that is provided you have to edit the following lines:....
    *  line 17: the source - these are the input files
>>> *  line 30: select your Global Tag: 
                STARTUP31X_V4::All  this is good for the low lumi trigger menu
                MC_31X_V5::All      this is good for the highlumi trigger menu
>>> *  line 71: the MET collection of your preference
                LINE 72: modify the "metSource"  to take whatever met you like
                the default  that is  given is     "met","","RECO"     that is 
		uncorrected Calo MET.
>>> *  line 96: select your Trigger path. There are 3 parameters that you set:
                LINE 96: HLT_process_name : high  (HLT)  or low (HLT8E29) lumi 
	                                    menu..............................
                LINE 98 and 100: the path and the filter names. For your...... 
	                         convenience all the correct pairs are given..
                                 at the end of the cfg file...................
>>> *  line102: the Filter: select the parameters that you want. ONLY these...
                parameters have to be changed:................................
                 ETCut   double the ET cut in the SC ET of the candidate
                 METCut  double the MET cut in the MET of the event

                              events  with a 2nd electron with ET>see nextpara
                 ETCut2ndEle double the ET cut for the 2nd electron rejection
                 electronMatched2HLT  bool demand the electron to be matched to
                             an HLT object (in Zee means at least one electron)

How to add the histograms and make the final plots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(applies to all versions)

After you have done these changes you can run over the grid over the different
datasets. The histograms are stored in root trees that you can hadd together.
For example if you have run over QCD Em enriched samples with say 10 jobs you
will finally get out 10 files
histos_1.root, histos_2, ...., histos_10.root
that you can combine
hadd histos_qcd.root histos_1.root histos_2.root ....

Having added the different bkgs together you set up file "inputFiles"
with the following format:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# zee or wenu
wenu
# file name, type (sig, qcd, bce, gje, ewk), weight
histos_wenu.root     sig     1.46
histos_q20_30.root   qcd     0
histos_q30_80.root   qcd     100.
histos_q80_170.root  qcd     0
histos_b20_30.root   bce     0
histos_b30_80.root   bce     0
histos_b80_170.root  bce     0
histos_zee.root      ewk     0
histos_wtaunu.root   ewk     0
histos_ztautau.root  ewk     0
histos_gj15.root     gje     0
histos_gj20.root     gje     0
histos_gj25.root     gje     10.12
histos_gj30.root     gje     0
histos_gj35.root     gje     0
histos_wmunu.root    ewk     0
histos_ttbar.root    ewk     0
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
lines that start with # are considered to be comments
line 2 has wenu or zee. From line 4 the list of the histo files are listed
(first word) then a type that could be sig,qcd,bce, gj or ewk in order to
discriminate among different sources of bkgs and finally the weight that we
want to weight the histogram entries. This particular example is for Wenu. For
Zee one has to put type sig in the zee file and ewk in the Wenu file. The order
of the files is arbitrary. Files with weight 0 will be ignored.
After you have set up this code you run a root macro to combine the plots.
You can do (not recommended - it actually crushes - to be debugged)
root -b PlotCombiner.cc 
or to compile it within root (recommended)
root -b
root [1] .L PlotCombiner.cc++
root [2] PlotCombiner()

and you finally get the plots.
