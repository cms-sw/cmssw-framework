v_29Oct09_2    ElectroWeakAnalysis/WENu    ElectroWeakAnalysis/ZEE
      version for 3_1_4, used with the OctX

v_10Dec09_v1   ElectroWeakAnalysis/WENu    ElectroWeakAnalysis/ZEE
      these work in 3_1 and later versions. There was a change in the PAT
      so that we cannot use ecalIso() etc methods, but we have to use instead
      userIsolation(pat::ecalIso) when we want to access the pat produced isolations
Note: from 3_3_1 onwards the pat::Electron object contains the ecalIso() etc functions
      that overload the pat::Lepton classes, giving the egamma stored values of the
      isolations. That was not the case in the previous versions


v_05Jan10_v1   ElectroWeakAnalysis/WENu    ElectroWeakAnalysis/ZEE
      the same as before, but now the file 
      DataFormats/METReco/interface/METCollection.h
      is obsolete. We can just replace this file with METFwd.h
      however it was decided to remove from the tag the file aod2patFilterWenu.cc
      and aod2patFilterZee.cc, because their use is deprecated
v_05Jan10_v3   ElectroWeakAnalysis/WENu    ElectroWeakAnalysis/ZEE
or V00-01-02
      a line in WENu/src/WenuPlots.cc was commented out so that there is no
      warning in compilation. The name V00-01-02 was done for compatibility
      CMS tag collector format and is is identical to v_05Jan10_v3



/ZEE V00-01-02-01 branch B3_4_X this is for a clean up in the TFileService
     all the following should be based on that

/ZEE    V00-01-02 
/WENu   V00-01-02     tags for 3_4_X release


/ZEE    V00-01-07     
/WENu   V00-01-06     tags for 3_6_X release

/ZEE    V00-01-08
/WENu   V00-01-07     tags for 3_6_X release     (again)


v_19Feb10_Hbk:    this is a back up for the WENu head, compiled and tested in 3_5_1
v_19Feb10_idmaps: this is the first implementation of the idmaps in WENu
                  there is a caveat there, only pat_WenuPlots.py is updated from the
                  cfgs

v_23Feb10_convrej_idmaps: adding on top of v_19Feb10_idmaps e/p and tip as variables
                  with default values 1000. in WenuCandidateFilter added the option
                  to use egamma conversion rejection, valid first PXB hit and
		  expected missing hits criteria. only pat_WenuPlots.py is updated.

v_25Feb10_convrej_idmaps : adding the option to calculate and store in the electron
                 conversion rejection and hit pattern info. only pat_WenuPlots.py is updated.
                 This tag also applies to ZEE
                 same in the zee candidate producer. But now the option to have separate cuts in each of the 2 electrons separately is added.
                 Caveat: the electrons are distinguished from the highest ET electron. Hence the selection 1 
                 is applied to the highest et electron and selection 2 to the other one. We may need something different 
                 in data, but we can change it if we like. the basic framework is there.
                 only pat_ZeePlots.py is updated.

v_1March10_convrej_idmaps : adding the option the 2nd ele id veto to be applied to
                 an electron that passes electron id. again only pat_WenuPlots.py
                 is updated. applicable to WENu only

/WENu  v_26May10_Spring10MC :  test version adding python directory with the spring10 tuned selections
                bug fixes and everything should work for Spring10 MC samples
		this tag works with RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification V00-03-07-02
		the tag is for the correct implementation of the electron ID cfgs in the python dir
		has to be updated for the latest tag of electron ID

/WENu V00-01-07-01 : version that works with CMSSW_3_6_1_patch2 and 
                V00-03-07-03   RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification
		Contains configuration valid for both data and MC, Spring10 selections implemented.

ZEE  V00-01-08-02 : version that works with CMSSW_3_6_1_patch2 and
                V00-03-07-03   RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification
		Contains configuration valid for both data and MC, Spring10 selections implemented.
		Similar to the WENu tag V00-01-07-01

V00-01-07-02  update of python configuration with the new cuts (Paolo's limits)     

/WENu         V00-01-07-03   same as V00-01-07-02 (i.e. Paolo's new limits) but all cfg.py are
	      updated so that you have 80% selection plus no 2nd ele with 95% selection, 25GeV 
	      and photon 10 trigger

/ZEE          V00-01-08-03 made to be similar to the WENu V00-01-07-03
              V00-01-08-04 to correct a bug in pushing back the 2nd leg variables, thanks to Jie Chen

/WENu         V00-01-08-01 major upgrade: VBTF ntuple production for CMSSW_3_6_1_patch4 (bug fix to V00-01-08)
              Needs the following tags: 
              RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification  V00-03-12
              RecoEgamma/EgammaTools             V00-05-05
              CondFormats/JetMETObjects          V01-09-01-09

V00-01-08-02 update, bug corrected
V00-01-08-03 update, 2nd ele included, same other tags as before
V00-01-08-04 update, bugs corrected
V00-01-08-05 same as before, but removing Delta eta cut for the Endcaps - EGAMMA ICHEP recommendation
V00-01-08-06 bug corrected in the HLT geometrical matching
             option added to store all the parameters of the second electron
V00-01-08-07 the primary vtx information is moved from the filter to the analyzer
             more variables stored: Rho of the SC, number of tracks per primary vtx (as a vector of ints)
             norm chi2 per primary vtx, both for offlineVertexCollection and offlineVertexCollectionBS
V00-01-08-08 slightly updated version of the previous tag, with a small "bug" corrected (set up to use
             the ideal magnetic field even in data if the current is not stored in the event). Intended 
             to be the last tag for the 3_6_X configuration. This tag can compile on 3_8_2 without further
             tags - however, wait for the 38 recipee, regarding JEC and egamma misalignment corrections.
V00-01-08-09 tag for 361: this is for the 3/pb VBTF ntuple production. 2 changes:
	     a. HoE cut in the cfgs becomes 0.15 - only WP95 is affected
	     b. trigger collection in WenuCandidateFilter is updated
V00-01-08-10 bug fix on the previous tag on the extra triggers in OR. The extra triggers were not looked for
             correctly and if they there first in the list of event triggers would not appear at all

V00-02-01    first dedicated tag to 38: the configuration has changed such that now the Deta cut in the EE is
             applied. Still needs extra tags:    V00-03-13      RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification
