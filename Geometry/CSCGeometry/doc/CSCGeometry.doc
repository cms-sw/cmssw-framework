\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->
Provides the geometrical model of the endcap muon CSC system as a container of CSCs (CSChamber objects). <br>
A CSCChamber is a concrete implementation of the GeomDet interface for a CSC. <br>
A CSCChamber is composed of 6 CSCLayer objects, each of which is a concrete implementation of a GeomDetUnit. <br>
Each CSCLayer contains concrete implementations of Topology objects to describe the wire and strip planes
in a layer of a CSC.

\subsection interface Primary public interface

- CSCGeometry
The entire model of the CSC endcap muon system. <br>
This isa TrackingGeometry. Basically a vector<CSCChamber*>.
- CSCChamber
Represents one CSC in the system. <br>
A CSC is composed of 6 layers so a CSCChamber is composed of 6 CSCLayer objects.
Basically a vector<CSCLayer*>. <br>
A CSCChamber can transform between local and global coordinates.
- CSCLayer
Represents one layer (gas+strip plane+wire plane) of a CSC. <br>
A CSCLayer can transform between local and global coordinates.

\subsection secint Secondary public interface
Mainly used by the above classes, but sometimes by other packages.

- CSCChamberSpecs
General properties of a CSC, e.g. dimensions. <br>
There are 10 types of chamber in the CSC system, corresponding to the combinations MEi/j
where i labels station 1-4, and j labels ring 1-3 (We have ME1/1, ME1/2, ME1/3, ME2/1, ME2/2, ME3/1, ME3/2, ME4/1, ME4/2).<br>
Within the software we also form a virtual ring j=4 to describe the inner region of ME1/1, which is known in the hardware
as ME1/1a. We then presume i=1, j=1 labels the outer region, which is known in hardware as ME1/1b.) <br>
BEWARE that sometimes there is optimization of the i, j labels in the 
software so one should always access them through the appropriate interfaces rather than attempting to decode
values stored internally in the objects. (Such relabelling is done, e.g., to optimize  DetLayer geometry access during 
muon track reconstruction.)<br>
The -z and +z endcaps are symmetric so only 10 CSCChamberSpecs objects in total are used, one per chamber type.

- CSCLayerGeometry
General properties of a CSC layer. <br>
Encapsulates the geometry of the strips in a CSCStripTopology and the geometry of the wires
in a CSCWireTopology. <br>
All values are in local coordinates. <br>
There are separate objects for odd and even layers in the 6 layers
of a CSC, and separate objects for the -z and +z endcaps, so there are 10 x 2 x 2 = 40 CSCLayerGeometry objects.

- CSCStripTopology
General properties of a strip plane. <br>
An OffsetRadialStripTopology matched to a CSC plane of strips.

- OffsetRadialStripTopology
A standard RadialStripTopology in which there is an angular offset between the plane of strips and the local coordinate 
system of the underlying DetUnit.

- CSCWireTopology
A WireTopology matched to a CSC plane of wires. <br>
Basically a WireTopology containing a CSCWireGeometry* and a CSCWireGrouping*.

- WireTopology
An abstract base class for detector planes of wires rather than strips. A Topology.

- CSCWireGeometry
Abstract class dealing with the spacing and angles of wires in a wire plane.

- nint
A nearest int function for floats and doubles. This was originally a CMS-wide function.

- CSCGattiFunction
Represents the expected functional form of the charge distribution on strips in a MWPC. <br>
This is required for
distributing simulated charge over strips during simulation. Although it is not strictly geometrical, 
it was not clear where else to package it.

\subsection other Classes not in public interface

- CSCNonslantedWireGeometry
- CSCSlantedWireGeometry

- CSCUngangedStripTopology

- CSCWireGrouping
Abstract class describing the wire group structure of a CSC wire plane - how the wires are grouped into readout channels.
- CSCGangedWireGrouping
- CSCUngangedWireGrouping
- CSCWireGroupPackage

\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->

I don't even know what a 'module' is, so I don't think there are any.

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->

No cppunit tests left since they were never properly supported or particularly useful. 
But there are 7 types of stand-alone test program in the test directory which are extremely useful
for examining what's in the CSCGeometry hierarchy.

\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->

Completed. Stable. (But tests will continue to be developed as appropriate.)
