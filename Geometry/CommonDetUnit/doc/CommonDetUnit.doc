\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->
Base classes modelling tracking detectors and the entry point to the geometry.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->

<b>Detector model:</b>
- GeomDet
- GeomDetUnit
- GeomDetType

<b>Geometry of GeomDet and GeomDetUnit:</b>

- TrackingGeometry is the base class for all tracking geometries (TrackerGeometry,
DTGeometry, CSCGeometry, RPCGeometry).
- GlobalTrackingGeometry is a is a single entry point to the geometries of the 
tracker and muon detectors. Its main purpose is to allow to get an element of the
geometry given its DetId, regardless of wich subdetector it belongs. 
A typical application is to transform to global coordinates the position of a list
of simhits or rechits that belong to several different tracking detectors.

Helper classes:
- DetSorting
- DetPositioner
- ModifiedSurfaceGenerator

\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->
The GlobalTrackingGeometry can be created in two ways:
- using globalTrackingGeometry.cfi, that also creates all slave geometries:
<pre>
include "Geometry/CommonDetUnit/data/globalTrackingGeometry.cfi"
</pre>

- using bareGlobalTrackingGeometry.cfi, which does not create any of the slave geometries and allows to specify only few of them.
<pre>
include "Geometry/CommonDetUnit/data/bareGlobalTrackingGeometry.cfi"
</pre>


\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->
- testDetSort.cpp : example and test for DetSorting helper classes.

A test and example application for GlobalTrackingGeometry can be found in 
package \ref Geometry_GlobalTrackingGeometryBuilder .

\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->
Completed.
