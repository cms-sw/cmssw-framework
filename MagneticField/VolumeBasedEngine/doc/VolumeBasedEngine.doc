\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

Engine for the volume-based magnetic field. For details, see CMS CR-2005/011.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->
No class is directly exposed to the user: field engines are accessed via the MagneticField interface.

The internal implementation is based on the following classes:

- VolumeBasedMagneticField : the concrete MagneticField engine.
- MagGeometry : the class handling the field volume geometry; normally not used directly by end users.


\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->

- VolumeBasedMagneticFieldESProducer.

To use this engine you should include in the cfi:

<pre>
include "Configuration/StandardSequences/data/MagneticField.cff"
</pre>

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->
An example of field access using this engine is provided in MagneticField/Engine/test/testMagneticField.cfg.

\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->
Stable.
