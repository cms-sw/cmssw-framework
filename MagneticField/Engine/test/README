Instructions to visualize the output of the Field validation test:
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure the validation test has been compiled (scramv1 b) and 
runs (cmsRun validateField.cfg) ... Then do:

source MakePlots.sh
(the script expects a table with all test points with the name "newtable.txt") 

The output will consist of 3 plots:

viewXY.png
view3D.png
viewXZ.png

All test points are shown in red, the outliers are shown in green.
You can view the above .png plots e.g. using the Unix program 'display'.
