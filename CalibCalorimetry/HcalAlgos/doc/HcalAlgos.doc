\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->
Algorithms immediately related with HCAL calibrations

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->
Converters:
- HcalDbASCIIIO: Read HCAL calibration objects from text file and write them into text files. Every file may contain one instance of one calibratiuon object.
- HcalDbHardcode: Defines default values for HCAL calibration objects. We attempt to have these numbers reasonable on the best effort basis. 
- HcalDbXml: Write HCAL calibrations in XML format suitable for loading into master DB
- HcalTimeSlew: HCAL readout time slew parameters

Analysis:
- HcalPedestalAnalysis: Algorithm to get new pedestals from pedestal run, validate them, and store in DB, if necessary
Utils:
- HcalAlgoUtils: auxiliraly utilities

\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->
None

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->
See:
- CalibCalorimetry/HcalPlugins for converters 
- CalibCalorimetry/HcalStandardModules for algorithms

\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->
- ASCII converters are stable
- XML converters follow XML uploader tools development
- HcalPedestalAnalysis is in prototype stage
