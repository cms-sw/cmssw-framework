\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

Place for all alignment relevant data formats.
Currently we make use of persistable formats in alignment for storing
overlap and prescale information for the AlCaSkim used by the HIP algorithm
for the tracker and for the interface of the tracker LAS to the track-based
algorithms.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->
- SiStripLaserRecHit2D: hit information deduced froma LAS profile
- TkLasBeam: collection of SiStripLaserRecHit2D of one beam, with identifier etc.
- TkLasFittedBeam: result of a fit to the hits of a TkLasBeam
- AlignmentClusterFlag: storing information about overlaps and prescales
- AliClusterValueMap: a map to get the AlignmentClusterFlag for a cluster

\subsection modules Modules

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->

\section status Status and planned development
