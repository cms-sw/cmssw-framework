\section desc Description
Implementation of \ref DataFormats_Candidate "Candidate" classes with analysis level additions, called PAT Candidates. A detailed description of PAT Candidates can be found on <a href=https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/WorkBookPATDataFormats>Workbook PAT Data Formats</a>.  
 

\subsection interface Public interface
- pat::Photon: data type to describe reconstructed photons, which is derived from the reco::Photon
- pat::Lepton: the pat::Electron, pat::Muon and pat::Tau inherit some common functionalities from pat::Lepton. Almost all of these features are related to isolation.  
- pat::Electron: data type to describe reconstructed electrons, which is derived from the reco::GsfElectron
- pat::Muon: data type to describe reconstructed muons, which is derived from the reco::Muon
- pat::Tau: data type to describe reconstructed taus, which is derived from the reco::BaseTau 
- pat::Jet: data type to describe reconstructed jets, which is derived from the reco::Jet
- pat::MET: data type to describe reconstructed MET, which is derived from the reco::MET

\subsection modules Modules
None.

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
None.

\section status Status and planned development
Complete.
