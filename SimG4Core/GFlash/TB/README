Test beam geometry/analysis related files for Geant4
------------------------------------------------------

* Note : This set of configuration works in CMSSW_2_1_0_pre3

BuildFile : This BuildFile doesn't work as it is
because scramv1 doesn't support non-standard directory structure
such as "TB". However we want to keep all Test beam related files
in TB directory because this is not going to be a part of either 
official compilation chain or test area.
So trick is that we keep everything in TB directory but when one
wants to build this producer one can copy BuildFile to test area
and specify file path accordingly.
To do that, one needs to copy BuildFile to ../test directory.

If there is any question about this, send an email to dwjang@fnal.gov

After making TB tree files in Geant4, the following files are used.

lateralAllCalib.cpp         : TB tree analysis script
myFunctions.cc              : utility funtions for lateralAllCalib
fitMaximumPoint.cc          : utility funtions for lateralAllCalib
Makefile                    : compile the above three files together
