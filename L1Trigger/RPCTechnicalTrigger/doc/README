Notes on the hardware-pseudoconfig.txt and hardware-pseudoconfig-TTU-X.txt files:

The "hardware-pseudoconfig.txt" describe some of the RPC-TT hardware configuration needed to run the emulator. It is equivalent in content to the 
sqlite file also included in this /test area.

Contents:

First part: RBC configuration x 30

line1: rbc_id wheel_id BCN0_delay Majority LogicName
line2: masked OR inputs
line3: forced OR inputs


Second block: TTU configuration x 3

line1: ttu_id run_type trigger_mode firmware_ver length_fiber delay max_wheels wheel_id1 wheel_id2 logic_name track_length
line2: masked sectors
line3: forced sectors

Default:

How to use it:


----------------------------

The test area also include two other configurations: hardware-pseudoconfig-TTU-3.txt and hardware-pseudoconfig-TTU-5.txt where the -X value says the 
majority level used for all the Logics.

Description of provided test cfg files:

rpcTechnicalTrigger_cfg.py: basic cfg file: can run on RelVal physics samples
rpcTechnicalTriggerData_cfg.py: example of running on data (CRAFT2)
rpcTechnicalTriggerCosmics_cfg.py: example of running on Cosmic MC samples: the base digi collection changes in this case to RPCSimLinks as instructed in this line:
"process.rpcTechnicalTrigger.UseRPCSimLink = cms.untracked.int32(1) "
