\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

L1 DT Track-Finder Emulator package.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->

- DTTrackFinder: EDProducer.

\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->

- DTTrackFinder: L1 DT Track-Finder Emulator module. Using L1MuDTChambPhDigis
		 and L1MuDTChambThDigis, generated by the DT Local Trigger
		 simulation or unpacked from the DTTF FED data, the module
		 computes the DTTF trigger muon candidates. These are stored in
		 a vector of L1MuRegionalCand objects. No parameters.

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->
The file test/runDTTF.cfg runs the DTTF Emulator, from a sample of DT trigger
primitives in a root file called generically DTPrimitives.root.
