\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

Implementation of the local Level-1 Cathode Strip Chamber trigger.
Simulates functionalities of the anode and cathode Local Charged
Tracks (LCT) processors, of the Trigger Mother Board, and of the Muon
Port Card (MPC).

Input to the simulation are collections of the CSC wire and comparator digis.

Produces four collections of the Level-1 CSC Trigger Primitives (track
stubs, or LCTs): anode LCTs (ALCTs), cathode LCTs (CLCTs), and
correlated LCTs before and after the MPC sorting/selection.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->
None.  Format of LCTs is defined in DataFormats/CSCDigi package.

\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->
