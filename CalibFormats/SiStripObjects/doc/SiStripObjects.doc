\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This package provides the classes that define the calibration objects
that are (usually) built from condition objects that are available via
the EventSetup interface. An example is the SiStripFecCabling object,
which provides information of the logical structure of the strip
tracker control system, as well and the FED cabling connections. This
is built from the SiStripFedCabling condition object (defined in
CondFormats/SiStripObjects).

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->

SiStripControlConnectivity (Will be deprecated soon.)
SiStripDetCabling This class contains the same information as provided
by the SiStripFedCabling condition object, manipulated to represent
the "DET" (or "geometrical") view of the detector. The class handles
FedChannelConnection objects (just as the SiStripFedCabling class).

SiStripFecCabling This class contains the same information as provided
by the SiStripFedCabling condition object, manipulated to represent
the "FEC" (or "control") view of the detector. The different levels
within the logical structure of the control system (FEC, ring, CCU,
front-end module) are each represented by a class (SiStripFec,
SiStripRing, SiStripCcu, SiStripModule) and a user can "drill down"
into the structure from the top-level SiStripFecCabling class. The
SiStripModule class contains all information relating to a given
front-end module and its connections.

SiStripReverseReadoutCabling (Will be deprecated soon.)
SiStripStructure (Will be deprecated soon.)

\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->

No plug-in modules.

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->

None.

\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->

FED cabling classes are essentially complete and stable.
