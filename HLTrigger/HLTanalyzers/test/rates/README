1. Introduction
************************************** 



--------------------------------------  
1a. Running the scripts
--------------------------------------  
 
	Once the binary file is built, the rate-calculating script can be run using:
	
	./OHltRates <NEntries> <sMenu> <sConditions> <sVersion> <sEnergy> <doPrintAll>

	The arguments are as follows:
		
		<NEntries>: Number of events to run over.
			    That number will be used for each sample.
			    If there exist less events in a sample than requested than the script
			    will run over all existing.
			    Any number < 0 will be interpreted as "running over all existing events".
			    Default is all (-1).
	
		<sMenu>: Type of trigger menu to run. Options are "default", "example", and "l1default".
			 The "default" option runs the full HLT menu using the trigger bits
			 from the standard HLT. The "example" menu will run the OpenHLT 
			 triggers together with a few triggers from the full HLT for comparison.
			 The method for adding new OpenHLT triggers is described below.
			 The "l1default" calculates the rates for the full L1 menu using the trigger bits
			 from the standard L1.

		<sConditions>: Options are "startup" and "ideal". The "startup" option
			       will run over events processed with 1pb-1 conditions. The "ideal" 
			       option will run over events processed with ideal conditions.

		<sVersion>: A string describing this menu. This will be appended to the name of 
			    the output files.

		<sEnergy>: sqrt(s) energy to assume for scaling cross-sections. Options are 10 and 14.
			   Note - the currently available samples were produced with 14TeV settings in 
			   CMSSW_1_8_4. 

		<doPrintAll>: If set to 1 all printouts incl. overlap coefficient etc,
			      and also the pdf file is generated.
			      Otherwise only the most info is printed out to stdout.
			      Default is off (0).

2. Input samples and cross-sections
**************************************

	The input ntuples and cross-sections are defined in the main() function in OHltRates.cpp.
	These are filled as entries in the vectors ProcFil and xsec, respectively. The current default 
	uses samples of Minbias, ppEleX, ppMuX.
	The example files exist on hep.wisc.edu. The script should be working if running there.

**************************************
3. Trigger examples
**************************************

        The list of OpenHLT triggers in the menu is defined in the BookMenu_OhltExample method in OHltRates.cpp.  
	Several OpenHLT trigger algorithms are already implemented as templates. These will be 
	executed when the script is run with the "example" option, together with the corresponding
	triggers from the full HLT. For example:

		./OHltRates 1000000 example

-------------------------------------- 
3a. Adding new OpenHLT triggers
-------------------------------------- 

        To add a new OpenHLT trigger, the first step is to register it in the menu. This requires adding a line 
	that calls AddHlt to the BookMenu_OhltExample method in OHltRates.cpp. This takes the form: 
 
                menu->AddHlt(TString trig, TString l1Bit, int l1prescale, int hltprescale, TString threshold, TString desc); 
 
        The arguments to this method will be used as labels in the output menu showing the rates, and 
	are defined as follows: 

                trig:           Name of the new OpenHLT trigger 
                l1Bit:          Name of the L1 bit used by this OpenHLT trigger
				(this parameter has no effect on the effective algorithm used, it is only for documentation,
				 to see how to change the L1 seed see below) 
                l1prescale:     Prescale value applied at L1 (This prescale will be applied on top of existing L1 prescales,
							      i.e. it should be used for samples with reset prescales only
							      unless the user knows exactly was he does)
                hltprescale:    Prescale value applied at HLT (This prescale will be applied on top of existing HLT prescales,
							      i.e. it should be used for samples with reset prescales only
							      unless the user knows exactly was he does)
                threshold:      HLT trigger threshold (this parameter is for documentation only) 
                desc:           Description string - for example "1e32" for  
                                triggers in the 10^32 menu, "new" for new developmental  
                                triggers, etc. (this parameter is for documentation only)

	Once the trigger is registered, the actual trigger logic must be implemented in OHltTree.cpp; this is done in 
	two places. The first is the OHltTree::Loop method, where the L1 and HLT pass/fail conditions are decided.
	The second is in dedicated methods where the HLT trigger algorithms are emulated. A single one of these dedicated
	methods can be used by several OpenHLT triggers if they differ only in their thresholds. 

	The standard HLT triggers can be added to the menu in the same way:

		menu->AddHlt(TString trig, TString l1Bit, int l1prescale, int hltprescale, TString threshold, TString desc);

	where the string "trig" should be the name of the trigger path.

	Several example OpenHLT triggers are provided as templates; these are described in detail below.

--------------------------------------  
3b. Example OpenHLT jet triggers  
--------------------------------------  
 
        One example OpenHLT jet trigger (corresponding to HLT1jet) is implemented. The algorithm is  
        implemented in the OHltTree::OpenHlt1JetPassed method. This method takes a single argument:

		double pt:	Jet pT threshold.

	The trigger passes if N>=1 jets above threshold are found in the event. 

--------------------------------------
3c. Example OpenHLT muon triggers
--------------------------------------
	
	Three example OpenHLT muon triggers (corresponding to HLT1MuonNonIso, HLT1MuonIso, and HLT2MuonNonIso) are 
	available. 

	The algorithm for the single muon triggers is implemented in the OHltTree::OpenHlt1MuonPassed method. This 
	takes five arguments:

		double ptl1:	L1extra pT threshold 
		double ptl2:	L2 muon pT threshold
		double ptl3:	L3 muon pT threshold
		double dr:	L3 dR threshold
		int iso:	L3 isolation (1 if isolated, 0 if non-isolated)

	The algorithm starts from L3 muons and applies pT, eta, dr, and isolation criteria. It 
	then finds the L2 muon matched to the L3 muon, and applies pT and eta cuts. It then finds
	the L1extra muon most closely matched to the L2 muon, and applies pT and quality cuts. For the 
	single muon triggers, the L1 quality must be between 4 and 7 (inclusive). The trigger passes if 
	N>=1 muons satisfying all these criteria are found.

	The algorithm for the double muon triggers is implemented in the OHltTree::OpenHlt2MuonPassed 
	method. The arguments to this method are:

	        double ptl1:    L1extra pT threshold  
                double ptl2:    L2 muon pT threshold 
                double ptl3:    L3 muon pT threshold 
                double dr:      L3 dR threshold 
                int iso:        L3 isolation (1 if isolated, 0 if non-isolated) 

	The algorithm is identical to the single muon case described above, with the exception of the L1extra muons, 
	which must have quality between 3 and 7 (inclusive). The trigger passes if N>=2 muons satisfying all these 
	criteria are found.

	* Note that in CMSSW releases 2_X and higher, the L2 and L3 muon pT thresholds are implemented as flat cuts.
	  In earlier releases, the thresholds were implemented as 90% CL upper limits. OpenHLT examples of the old pT 
	  threshold implementation are found at the beginning of the OpenHlt1MuonPassed and OpenHlt2MuonPassed examples.


--------------------------------------
3d. Example OpenHLT electron triggers
--------------------------------------
	
	One example OpenHLT electron trigger (HLT1Electron) are	available. 

	The algorithm for the single electron triggers is implemented in the OHltTree::OpenHlt1ElectronPassed method.
        This takes five arguments:

		float   Et:	Et threshold in GeV
		int   L1iso:	L1 is isolated (1: yes, 0: no)
		float Tiso:	Track isolation in GeV
		float Hiso:	Hcal isolation in GeV

	In the example code some cuts are mandatory and cannot be varied.
	They have the following default values:
		ohEleNewSC[i]>0                 : Is 1, if electron found by Super Cluster Algo, otherwise 0
		ohEleHiso[i]/ohEleEt[i] < 0.05	: Hadronic fraction smaller than 0.05
		ohElePixelSeeds[i]>0		: Pixel seed found or not (1 or 0)

--------------------------------------
3e. Example OpenHLT photon triggers
--------------------------------------
	
	One example OpenHLT electron trigger (HLT1Electron) are	available. 

	The algorithm for the single electron triggers is implemented in the OHltTree::OpenHlt1ElectronPassed method.
        This takes five arguments:

		float   Et:	Et threshold in GeV
		int   L1iso:	L1 is isolated (1: yes, 0: no)
		float Tiso:	Track isolation in GeV
		float Eiso:	Ecal isolation in GeV
		float HisoBR:	Barrel Hcal isolation in GeV
		float HisoEC:	Endcap Hcal isolation in GeV


--------------------------------------
3f. Example OpenHLT tau triggers
--------------------------------------
	
	Several examples are available in OHltTree.cpp. 

	The algorithm for the Tau triggers is implemented in OHltTree::OpenHltTauPassed method.
        As an example one can take the HLT2TauPixel path, which can be implemented as

	if(OpenHltTauPassed(15.,5.,3.,1,0.,0)>=2) {} using
        OpenHltTauPassed(float Et,float Eiso, float L25Tpt, int L25Tiso, float L3Tpt, int L3Tiso)

	The if statement asks for at least 2 tau candidates which fullfil both these criteria:	      

		float   Et:	L2 calo Et threshold in GeV
		int   Eiso:	L2 is Ecal isolated (1: yes, 0: no)
		float L25Tpt:	L2.5 pixel leading Track Pt threshold in GeV
		int   L25Tiso:	L2.5 is Track isolated (1: yes, 0: no)
		float L3Tpt:	L3 si+pix leading Track Pt threshold in GeV
		int   L3Tiso:	L3 is Track isolated (1: yes, 0: no)
