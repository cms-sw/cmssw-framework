\subsection modules Modules

- TrackProducer : Create the TrackProducer framework module
The track producer module build Track and TrackExtra from TrackCandidate. The TrackCandidate
can be generated both from Combinatorial Track Finder then from Road Search Track Finder.
To propagate the track throught the detector during the fitting phase the TrackProducer can
use two different propagator: the analytical propagator and the propagator with material.
The following cfi configuration files allow to run the TrackProducer with the standard 
reconstruction chain using different options

Combinatorial track finder with analytical propagator
<pre>
\htmlinclude CTFFinalFitAnalytical.cfi
</pre>

Combinatorial track finder with material propagator
<pre>
\htmlinclude CTFFinalFitWithMaterial.cfi
</pre>

Road search track finder with analytical propagator
<pre>
\htmlinclude RSFinalFitAnalytical.cfi
</pre>

Road search track finder with material propagator
<pre>
\htmlinclude RSFinalFitWithMaterial.cfi
</pre>
