          RecHitD

	  =============================
	  author: Stoyan Stoynev, NU


	  This rechit builder uses much of the code (a copy) from RecHitB.
	  The substantial difference is that no Gatti fitting is applied
	  for strip hit coordinate (and error) estimation. However the Gatti
	  distribution is virtually used.

	  Step one:
	  A position estimator called X_Florida is used for initial position
	  estimation. Three charges from the three adjacent strips are the input.
	  These are charges from three time bins summed. Besides, every charge
	  in a time bin is XTalk corrected (see CSCXonStrip_MatchGatti::setupMatrix()).
	  No negative charges are allowed after the XTalk correction!
	  X_Florida = (RightCharge - LeftCharge)/(CentralCharge - min(Left, Right))

	  Step two:
	  A correction to X_Florida is made. It depends on the strip width and
	  X_Florida itself. These corrections are parametrized in
	  HardCodedCorrectionInitialization.cc. A linear interpolation is applied
	  between points.
	  The corrections are obtained in the following way.
	  The gatti distribution (induced charge distribution) is generated
	  for specific strip width. Then for a given offset (simulating the
	  hit offset from the center of the strip) the charges for the three strips are
	  extracted and X_Florida is calculated. The initial offset is
	  in fact X_Gatti (the maximum of the distribution is at X_Gatti
	  by definition), i.e. the position within the strip as predicted by
	  the Gatti distribution.
	  The correction is Correction = X_Gatti - X_Florida  (there are no
	  ambiguities) or in other words - the correction that should be
	  applied to X_Florida in order to obtain X_Gatti.
	  Thus the corrected X_Florida is effectively X_Gatti.
	  In reality various systematic factors make this only an approximation
	  (which is also true when we use a real Gatti fitting!).

	  Step three:
	  The uncertainty of the position is calculated by error propagation.
	  Studies show that three factors play a role:
	  Noise, XTalk asymmetry (or similar effects), constant term. These three
	  factors should be obtained by studies.

Note: The theoretical Gatti distribution depends on chamber parameters 
      (of course). For all but ME1/1 chambers the relevant parameters 
      are practically the same. So there are two types of corrections:
      for ME1/1 chambers and for non-ME1/1 chambers. All are encoded in
      HardCodedCorrectionInitialization.cc.
