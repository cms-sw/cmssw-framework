\section desc Configuration Package for RecoLocalMuon Sequences and Event Content definitions

\subsection files Configuration Fragments

- \b RecoLocalMuon.cff : configuration fragment which defines the sequences

- \b RecoLocalMuon_EventContent.cff : configuration fragment which contains blocks definitions for FullEvent, \ref RecoData "RECO" and \ref AodData "AOD"

\subsection seq Sequences

- \b dtlocalreco : sequence to perform DT local reconstruction. This sequence is used in the standard reconstruction chain. The reconstruction of the 2D segments are not required for the 4D segments reconstruction, they are used only for debuging purpose and for specific studies.
- \b dtlocalreco_with_2DSegments : sequence to perform DT local reconstruction and the 2D segments reconstruction.
- \b csclocalreco : sequence to perform CSC local reconstruction. 
- \b muonlocalreco_with_2DSegments : sequence to perform DT, CSC and RPC local reconstruction (debuging purpose and specific studies).
- \b muonlocalreco : sequence to perform DT, CSC and RPC local reconstruction (sequence to be used for the standard reconstruction chain).

The RPC local reconstruction doesn't need a sequence. To perform only the RPC reconstruction just use rpcRecHits in
the execution's path.

\htmlinclude RecoLocalMuon.cff

.
\b inputs are:
- DT Digis for the 1D rec hits producer (and indeed the starting input for the whole DT local reconstruction's chain):
  - From simulated data: \b InputTag = muonDTDigis
  - From real data: \b InputTag = dtunpacker

- CSC Digis for the 2D rec hits (starting input for the whole CSC local reconstruction's chain): 
  - Strip's digis: \b string CSCStripDigiProducer = "muonCSCDigis"
  - Wire's digis:  \b string CSCWireDigiProducer  = "muonCSCDigis"
  Pay attention! Both of them are mandatory for the reconstruction.

- RPC Digis: 
 \b InputTag = muonRPCDigis

\b Note. The following inputs are automatically taken into account inside the reconstruction's chain:

- For the 2D and 4D segments reconstruction:
  - 2D segments producer needs \b InputTag = dt1DRecHits
  - 4D segments producer needs \b InputTag = dt1DRecHits and \b InputTag = dt2DSegments
   The 2D segments are used for debugging and performance's studies. They are put in the whole chain by default,
   but to perform the whole muon reconstruction (i.e. up to the reco::Muon objects) they are not required. 

- For the CSC's segments reconstruction:
  - Segments producer needs \b InputTag = csc2DRecHits

products are:
 - DT.
   InputTag: \b dt1DRecHits, \b dt2DSegments, \b dt4DSegments
 - CSC.
   InputTag: \b csc2DRecHits, \b cscSegments
 - RPC. 
   InputTags: \b rpcRecHits

\subsection eventc EventContent

- \b the FEVT (Full Event), \ref RecoData "RECO" and \ref AodData "AOD" Tier save the following products:
